### ⚠️ Phishing Indicators

| Red Flag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🟥 **Sender Email Mismatch** | The sender claims to be from Microsoft, but the domain is `refreshfaces.com`, which is unrelated to Microsoft. Legitimate companies use their own verified domains. |
| 🟥 **Unusual Attachment** | A `.mobileconfig` file is attached — typically used to configure device settings. Microsoft never sends such files unsolicited. |
| 🟥 **Mismatched Branding** | The Microsoft logo is of poor quality and the email formatting doesn't match Microsoft’s usual style. |
| 🟥 **Urgency Tactic** | “Your Office365 renewal failed” message creates panic to trick users into acting quickly without thinking. |
| 🟥 **Misleading CTA Button** | “Billing Details” button likely leads to a phishing site. Always verify links before clicking. |
| 🟥 **Incoherent Text** | Mentions of “Postnup and Will” are unrelated to the context — a clear sign the message was hastily assembled or recycled. |
