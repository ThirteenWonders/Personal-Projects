### ⚠️ Phishing Indicators

| Red Flag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🟥 **Suspicious Sender Address** | The email claims to be from Gemini, but the domain is `listedoveoux.com`, which is completely unrelated. Legitimate notifications should come from `@gemini.com`. |
| 🟥 **Unusual Attachment** | A `.mobileconfig` file is attached again — a rare and highly suspicious file type, often used to tamper with mobile settings or profiles. |
| 🟥 **Scare Tactic (Unauthorized Login Alert)** | The email claims there's been a login from Singapore using a Samsung device — a common scare tactic to make users act impulsively. |
| 🟥 **Urgency Without a Secure Resolution Path** | Instead of linking to Gemini’s official support channels or dashboard, the email provides a phone number — which could be tied to a scam operation. |
| 🟥 **Formatting and Branding** | The layout mimics professional alerts, but subtle inconsistencies in font, spacing, and phrasing can betray its authenticity. |
| 🟥 **Generic Structure** | Legitimate companies usually include your name or partial account details. This email lacks personalization entirely. |
