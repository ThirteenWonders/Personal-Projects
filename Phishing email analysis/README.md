## 🧠 Purpose

Phishing remains one of the most common and effective attack vectors in both personal and enterprise environments. This repository aims to:

- Recognize phishing indicators
- Educate others on how to spot phishing attempts
- Document real-world examples for awareness and learning

## 🧩 Structure

Each phishing email example includes:

- ✅ **Screenshot** (with personal details censored)
- ⚠️ **Red Flags**: A list of suspicious elements identified
- 🔍 **Analysis**: Why this email is likely a phishing attempt
- 💡 **Takeaway**: What the average user can learn from this case

## 📝 Case Highlight

**⚠️ Case 03 stands out as a highly deceptive phishing attempt.**  
It closely mimics a legitimate email from Gemini, referencing real-world topics such as SEC regulatory compliance and self-custody. The message includes:

- **Authentic-looking branding and layout**
- **Use of actual Gemini contact addresses** like `support@gemini.com` and `security@gemini.com`
- A **realistic narrative** around crypto migration to Exodus wallets
- A fake but convincingly formatted **12-word seed phrase**, which if used, would directly compromise a user's crypto assets

> This example illustrates how phishing emails are evolving to appear nearly indistinguishable from legitimate communications — making awareness and analysis more important than ever.
