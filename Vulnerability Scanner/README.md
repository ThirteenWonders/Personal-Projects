# Web Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a Python-based **Web vulnerability scanner** designed for educational and testing purposes against deliberately insecure web applications like **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**. It automates detection of common web vulnerabilities using both HTTP requests and browser automation via Selenium.

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ **Login automation** (supports CSRF tokens)
- ‚úÖ **Recursive crawling** of the target website
- ‚úÖ **Detection of**:
  - ‚úÖ**Sensitive Information Exposure**
  - ‚úÖ**SQL Injection (GET-based)**
  - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (via Selenium browser automation) *Still work in progress

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- `requests` ‚Äì for HTTP session management  
- `BeautifulSoup` ‚Äì for HTML parsing  
- `re` ‚Äì for pattern matching  
- `Selenium` ‚Äì for dynamic XSS testing in a browser  
- `ChromeDriver` ‚Äì controlled using `webdriver-manager

## Docker
Docker was used to run the DVWA environment in a container

WARNING: DO NOT DEPLOY DVWA IN A INTERNET FACING HOST

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Ensure DVWA is running locally at: `http://localhost:8080`
2. Set DVWA **security level to "Low"**
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. After setting up, run the following command in terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell)
   - "python scanner.py http://localhost:8080"
   - replace "http.//localhost:8080" with any site you wish to scan*
